# Configuration for World Border Tiers in AdvancedCoreRealms
#
# This file defines different upgradeable tiers for realm world borders.
# Each tier has a unique ID (e.g., 'tier_1', 'default') and several properties:
#
# - size: The diameter of the world border in blocks.
# - center_x: The default X-coordinate for the border center. Can be overridden per-realm.
# - center_z: The default Z-coordinate for the border center. Can be overridden per-realm.
# - warning_distance: Distance in blocks from the border where a warning appears.
# - warning_time: Time in seconds a player has to get back inside before taking damage.
# - transition_time: Time in seconds for the border to smoothly transition to this size.
# - cost_to_upgrade: The cost (using the server's economy) to upgrade to this tier. Set to 0 if free.
#
# The 'default_tier' key specifies which tier to use for newly created realms
# if their template doesn't specify one.
